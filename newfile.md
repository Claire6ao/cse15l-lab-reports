<h3>1. cd</h3>

<h4>1.1 cd without argument:</h4>
the absolute path to the working directory right before was <code>/Users/clairegao</code>.<br>
there is no output. That's because <code>cd</code> is to change directory to the command after and if we put nothing after cd, the directory would not be changed. <br>
This output is not an error.

<h4>1.2 cd with a path to directory:</h4>
the absolute path to the working directory right before was <code>/Users/clairegao</code>.<br>
there is no output. However, the directory is now changed to <code>/Users/clairegao/Downloads</code>.<br>
there is no error.

<h4>1.3 cd with a path to file:</h4>
the the absolute path to the working directory right before was <code>/Users/clairegao/Downloads</code>.
there is an error. That's because <code>cd</code>  is to change directory, and if we provide the path to a file, which is not a directory, it will cause an error. 
   
<h3>2. ls</h3>

<h4>2.1 ls without argument:</h4>
the absolute path to the working directory right before was <code>/Users/clairegao</code>.<br>
the output is all the files and directories under a the currect directory.<br>
This output is not an error.

<h4>2.2 ls with a path to directory:</h4>
the absolute path to the working directory right before was <code>/Users/clairegao</code>. <br>
Since the command after <code>ls</code> is <code>/Users/clairegao/Downloards</code>. the output lists all the files under the directory is <code>/Users/clairegao/Downloards</code>. <br>
there is no error.

<h4>2.3 ls with a path to file:</h4>
the absolute path to the working directory right before was <code>/Users/clairegao</code>. <br>
When we provide a path to a file. <code>ls</code> will display the path to the specific file. <br>
there is no error
